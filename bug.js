This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with custom camera controls.  The issue manifests as inconsistent or unexpected behavior when handling the camera's `onCameraReady` event, particularly after a change in camera permissions or switching between front and rear cameras.  The `onCameraReady` event may not fire reliably, causing the app to display an incorrect or blank preview, or preventing access to camera functions.
